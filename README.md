## Hello 👋

I'm Diyorbek Ibragimov, a third-year CS student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am passionate about **Machine Learning** and **Computer Systems**.

I’m currently building a system for **distributed ML model allocation and inference scheduling** across IoT devices.

I’ve:
- Deployed a GitHub triage model with IBM + RedHat for the **OpenJ9** project  
- Researched **Edge AI** and **Federated Learning** for model training and inference on edge.
- Built full-stack platforms with **Django**, **TypeScript**, and **React Native**

I’m open to **research collaborations**—feel free to reach out:

**Fun fact:** I’m a huge Witcher fan.
