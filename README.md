## Hello 👋

My name is Diyorbek Ibragimov. I am a third-year CS student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am passionate about **Machine Learning** and **Computer Systems**.

I am currently building a system for **distributed ML model allocation and inference scheduling** across IoT devices.

I have:
- Deployed a GitHub triage model with IBM + RedHat for the **OpenJ9** project  
- Researched **Edge AI** and **Federated Learning** for model training and inference on edge.
- Built full-stack platforms with **Django**, **TypeScript**, and **React Native**

Open to **research collaborations**—feel free to reach out:
